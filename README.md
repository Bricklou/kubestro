# kubestro

A kubernetes automated dashboard to deploy your Minecraft servers.

## Description

When deploying a Minecraft server, we often use the same tools : hosting
providers, bare bones linux server, docker container, Pterodactyl instance, etc.
What i'm looking for, is something similar to what we know with Pterodactyl : a
good and simple to use web dashboard to deploy servers but, this time, inside a
Kubernetes cluster.

This mainly answer a personal desire to take the advantage of my own Kubernetes
cluster to deploy any kind of Minecraft servers.
